		<h1>What we do</h1>
		<p>At <span class="mdc"><span class="mdc">Martes Delta Co</span></span>, we're interested in making technology work for you. Whether you have an idea for a mobile app, a product or service you need to market online, or a prototype of an electronic device built, we can (probably) help. And if you need something beyond our capabilities, we can probably put you in touch with the right person.</p>
		<p>We've been doing "this stuff" for about 20 years, now. We've designed and/or built web sites and web applications for everyone from mom and pop to Fortune 50 companies. We've built mobile applications, games, and more. Every once in a while we even get to play with high voltage! We've built a few hardware prototypes with things like Aruduino, Raspberry Pi and the like as well. We have some 3D printers, and we're not (too) afraid to use them!</p>

		<h1>Who we are</h1>
		<h3>Thomas Q Brady, owner</h3>
		<p>Thomas has been working in software design and development for about 20 years, having worked for companies like Visa, Polycom, Zynga, H-E-B, Dell, and frog, as well as at some startups and incubators you may not have heard of. He's been a "design technologist" (someone who straddles the fence between design and engineering, often working right at that intersection by building prototypes or doing other tasks that require both skillsets) for most of his career, but has also had titles like UX designer, interaction designer, front-end engineer, and he was even a technical writer at one point.</p>

		<h1>What things cost</h1>
		<p>We'll level with you: we're still figuring that out. <span class="mdc">Martes Delta Co</span> aims to be a sliding-scale sort of an outfit in the long-run. We would love to have a model wherein we can do really cool shit with people who can afford that, but still help the restaurant around the corner that wants a good online ordering experience and thinks they can't afford it, either by simplifying until it's affordable enough, or even doing some occasional pro <a href="https://www.biography.com/musician/bono">bono</a> work.</p>
